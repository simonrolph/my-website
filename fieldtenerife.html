        <h2>Aims of the Fieldcourse</h2>
        <p>The Spanish Field Course to Tenerife aims to provide an understanding of the biodiversity and ecology of an island which has high levels of endemism and a variety of habitats, and at the same time hosts a large tourism industry. We will examine the adaptations of plants and animals to habitats ranging from arid scrublands to humid laurel forests and coniferous woodlands; and you will consider issues of human/wildlife conflicts and synergies on the island. This will be achieved through a series of walks, tours, exercises, research projects and discussions. The course is assessed during the trip during discussions (20%). On return you will be assessed on a poster that you create from your project work (25%); and on making a 3 minute video (15%). There is also a written exam with 2 essays during the summer exam period (40%).</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction: Location, Flora and Fauna</h2>
        <p>The Spanish island of Tenerife is one of the Canary Islands. It is located over 1000 km from mainland Spain, and about 100km from North West Africa. The Canary archipelago was formed by eruptions of the earth’s surface millions of years ago, and the islands are effectively the tips of a series of volacanoes, some of which are still active. Tenerife is crowned by the volcanic Mount Teide, the highest mountain (3,718 m) in Spain. The Canary Islands are part of the biogeographic region called Macaronesia which is known for its rich floristic and faunistic diversity, with over 600 endemic species.</p>
        <p>Diversity of climate and altitude result in a complex variety of vegetational habitats across Tenerife, ranging from arid xerophytic scrub (the ‘malpais’ or badlands) to humid laurel forests (the ‘laurisilva’) in the north. In the middle of the island, the The Parque Nacional de Teide contains many rare endemic species living in the montane zone above 1900 m. Examples of plant species endemic to these habitats in the Canary Islands include various Euphorbia species in the ‘malpais’ scrub, Canary Palms (Phoenix canariensis) and Canary Junipers (<em>Juniperus turbinata ssp. Canariensis</em>). Most distinctive is the Dragon Tree (<em>Dracaena draco</em>), a Macaronesian endemic member of the Lily family (Liliaceae).</p>

        <p>With respect to fauna, the ‘malpais’ scrub has a variety of lizards (<em>Gallotia species</em>) and geckos. The laurel forests have endemic laurel pigeons, and the pine forests have endemic Great Spotted Woodpeckers (<em>Dendrocopos major</em>) and are the favoured habitat of the Canary endemic Blue Chaffinch (<em>Fringilla teydea teydea</em>) which feeds on pine kernels.</p>
        <p>The coastal areas of Tenerife present some interesting challenges with respect to the sharing of land and sea between wildlife and humans, as the tourist industry drives development. A variety of sea birds and sea mammals are affected by the increased human population utilising the area. There are 21 species of whale and dolphin in the waters around the Canary Islands. Most common are pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins.</p>
<p>This concentration of habitats and diversity on one island will give us the opportunity to explore themes relating to biogeography, habitat zonation, human-wildlife conflict and ecosystem services, as well as providing the ideal setting for more detailed studies of behavioural ecology and plant-insect interactions (such as pollination and herbivory). </p>
        
        <h2>Monteverde / Laurel Forests (400-1300m)</h2>
        <a data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="false"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139104305@N05/albums/72157663096189100" title="Laurel Forest - Tenerife"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1460/24162755250_5305e4d8f3_c.jpg" width="900" height="675" alt="Laurel Forest - Tenerife"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Monteverde is used to refer to the laurisilva woodland and the myrtle/tree heather communities (fayal-brezal), only about 10% of the original forest remains. This type of forest develops due to the high rainfall (1000mm year-1) and or cloud cover which allows this lush vegetation to develop. The moderate temperatures (15°C) also ensure good growth. The clouds develop due to the Trade Winds and can provide 5 times more water than the rainfall itself. These forests are often covered in lichens and you can see good examples of this on the Anaga Peninsula.</p>
            <p>This the habitat you can find the beutiful endemic canary bellflower (<em>Canarina canariensis</em>) and a wonderful vaerity of fern and moss species. This is also the only habitat that the laurel pigeon (<em>Columba junoniae</em>) lives in.</p>
        
        <h2>Pine Zone (800-1900m)</h2>
        <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139104305@N05/albums/72157663096596220" title="Pine Forest Zone - Tenerife"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1628/24350303102_ebab22b673_c.jpg" width="8900" height="675" alt="Pine Forest Zone - Tenerife"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            <p>The pine woods are dominated by the Canary Pine (<em>Pinus canariensis</em>) with relatively few species found in the understory. The Canary Pine can grow to 50 metres tall but are usually found at 20-30 metres tall, with a trunk diamater of 1 metre. They are also very fire resistant  and can resprout from the trunk after fire damage, it also has very long needles up to 30cm long. After periods of growing non-native trees for lumber, the government is starting to replant however as they grow the forest is getting more dense and funding cuts to forest-fire management has lead to neglect of fire risk management. A charactersitic of the pine forests is that very few other plants are found below the thick canopy of the pine trees.</p>
            <p>Pine forests are vital for the water economy of Tenerife as they collect from the condesnsing clouds as they pass over the higher altitudes of the island. Water use is a huge issue in Tenerife, many bore holes have been driven deep into the island to extract water to supply the demands of the tourist industry. </p>
            <p>This is where you can find the endangered endemic blue chaffinch (<em>Fringilla teydea</em>), you can read more <a href="http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/factsheet/22720036">here</a>. We sadly did not see this bird on our field course.</p>
        
        <h2>Montane Zone (>1900m)</h2>
        <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139104305@N05/albums/72157663538882141" title="Montane Zone - Tenerife"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1451/24458636455_3dc83d6726_c.jpg" width="900" height="675" alt="Montane Zone - Tenerife"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>The vegetation consists of open scrub with shrubs belonging mainly to the Fabaceae (Leguminosae), and many rare endemics. The Cañadas National Park has the richest montane flora in the Canary Islands with many endemics - collecting is strictly forbidden and this is enforced by wardens. The highest slopes of Pico de Teide have only a single species, a violet endemic to Tenerife, <em>Viola cheiranthifolia.</em></p>
            <p>There are a number of conservation issues relation to this ecosystem. Firstly, bee-keepers trying to produce the valuable Teide blossom honey will import huge numbers of bees which is likely affecting native endemic bumble bee species <em>bombus canariensis</em> and the plants themselves. Secondly, a species of plant known as broom is experiencing an extreme die-off, this can be seen in the pictures above and the reasons are not entirely known. One theory was that a moth species was introduced by discarded orange peel, but our experts didn't agree.</p>
            <p>Also in the pictures you will see the Teide bugloss <em>Echium wildpretii</em>. A boraginaceae with a pyramid-shaped inflorescence of red flowers that can grow to a height of 3 metres, making it one of the most striking plants during the flowering season. It blooms after two years and it is a honey producing plant.</p>
        
        <h2>Xeromorphic Coastal Zone (0-500m)</h2>
        <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139104305@N05/albums/72157663538657951" title="Coastal zone - Tenerife"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1578/24090727909_901830b52e_c.jpg" width="900" height="675" alt="Coastal zone - Tenerife"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>The climax communities of this zone basically consist of variable-cover scrub which comprise species that have developed a great number of adaptive strategies in order to overcome the adverse conditions prevailing in this zone (lack of moisture, intense heat, excessive UV radiation). Plants to look out for are: </p>
        <p><em>Euphorbia canariensis</em> – endemic cactus like plant</p>
        <p>Prickly pear (<em>Opuntia sp.</em>) – exotic</p>
            
<p>This zone occupies the lower slopes of the island and stem and leaf succulents predominate, with species of Euphorbia, Aeonium and Compositae the commonest. Some of the cliff areas (e.g. Punta de Teno) have many relict endemics with affinities with species in east and south Africa and South America. At its upper limit the xerophytic scrub zone gives way to forest scrub zone with <em>Erica arborea</em> (tree heath) and <em>Juniperus phoenicea</em> (juniper).</p>
