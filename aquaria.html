        <h1>Aquaria - Looking through the glass</h1>
        <div>
        <h2>Why Aquariums?</h2>
        <p>I've always been interested in systems. Aquariums allow you to oberve an entire ecosystem, you notice the slow changes over time, it gives you a beautiful insight into the flow and cycling within these self-contained biological systems. Hopefully through sharing and describing my ventures into the concept of putting stuff in a glass container and peering at them you too will love aquaria!</p>
        
        <h2>The Early Years</h2>
        <p>My love of all things aquaria kicked off when we dug a pond in the garden, I have fond memories of spending hours throughout the year going pond-dipping. The array of creatures supported by a simple pond to this day still amazes me; a vibrant diversity of invertebrates and an impressive population of newts. I had kept sea-monkeys and started keeping bottles of pondwater on my window sill so I could observe these closed systems. Following the discovery of newtspawn in the pond I set about rearing them from tiny eggs to fully formed tiny newts before releasing them back into the pond, watching in facination as they developed. I distinctly remember studying their feeding strategy; they sat motionless until a tiny invertebrate unknownlingly swam too close, then in a flash it was gone. Everyone else can have their lions, tigers and the rest of the classically megafauna, I was hooked on creatures 2cm long and lurking in a pond. Next it was the frogspawn and tadpoles but I started iching for a bigger project.</p>
        <p>My first aquarium with fish was a 60 litre tropical aquiarium and I had the usuals; zebra danios, neon tetras, platys... and subsequently more platys! They were easy to breed, the excitement of finding my first fry was immeasurable. We originally bought two different platy variants, orange and blue, thus the crossbreeds were a curious mix with each offspring taking different characterisitcs from each parent. My room became progressively aquaria focussed as I obtained a second tank for breeding and quarentine, which I later sold to my physics teacher, as you do. </p>
        <h2>The Hobby Grows</h2>
        <p>Soon feeling a bit claustraphobic in the small 60 litre aquarium I upscaled to a 180 litre aquarium, after my first experience with Ebay! This tank nowadays sits proudly in the breakfast room in my parent's <a href="http://www.thedellhouse.co.uk">Dell House Bed & Breakfast</a>. I did well in my GCSEs and A levels then took a year out before university, having already secured my place at the University of Exeter to study conservation biology and ecology.</p>
        <h2>Rockpooling at Cardigan Bay</h2>
        
        <p>As part of my four months volunteering with <a href="www.cbmwc.org">Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre</a> I managed a 300 litre rockpool aquarium. The visitor centre was suitably close to the beach that I could take whatever I wanted and, just as easily, return it back to the wild. This freedom was fantastic, I would go rockpooling with a bucket searching for new and interesting finds. </p>

            <table>
            <td>The Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre aqurium in all its glory!</td></table>
        <p>Much of my free time during the placement, in absence of much else better to do, was spent observing the wonderful zoo of rockpool creatures under my care. Some highlights include; </p>
            <p>A nocturnal edible crab (<em>Cancer pagurus</em>) nicknamed Edmund, never seen during the day, but when you return in the morning chances are he'd taken out an enemy crab, he soon got put back. He even managed to take a claw off a larger velvet swimming crab!</p>
            <p>A shoal of about 15 juvenile thick lipped grey mullet (<em>Chelon labrosus</em>) each of about 4 cm long. I had been on the look-out for a nice shoaling fish after my first attempt at introducing sand eels (<em>Ammodytes tobianus</em>) resulted in them becoming very stressed and swimming into the claws of a eager crab, or an anenome...</p>
            <p>A charming juvenile flatfish (never managed to identify it to species level), for which I specially created a sandy area, but it never managed to cope with the concept of glass so I returned it soon, although I was very impressed with its ability to swallow a prawn whole!</p>
        <p>I took great pride in my work on this aquarium and spent time researching online and reading books about the species I was looking after, eventually I produced a guide for aquarium care so that when I my placement was finished anyone could pick up where I left off and continue to make the aquarium a real attraction in the visitor centre. This valuable opportunity really re-ignited my love for aquaria, especially native British aquaria where the natural world is your fish shop.</p>
        <h2>Tadpoles and Sticklebacks</h2>

            <td>The upgraded froglet aquarium/vivarium.</td></table>
        <p>I started univeristy in Falmouth, but didn't have any aquariums... something had to change! I got hold of two secondhand tanks and set them up in my room in student halls (not entirely sure if they were allowed but they never seemed too bothered). In spring of my first year at uni I kept tadpoles to frogs, I remember keeping tapdole and newt tadpoles as a young child and wanted to do the same again. It is a very valuable learning experience seeing them develop, it's good fun too! Check out the photo album below to watch them grow!</p>

        <p>Always looking to get bigger and better I found a pond in Falmouth that contained three-spined sticklebacks and decided to keep them. These were very interesting to watch and study. To start with they were very terrirorial, one male especially. The warmth of my room caused them to bring out their spring colouration and this troublesome started building a nest and guarding it, in such a small tank it was causing disturbance to the others so I returned this male. They fed on any form of insect larve, when I first set up the tank there were a number of waterhog lice, once the stickleback had been introduced they were all hiding underneath the log. On a slightly unrelated note, some of the water hoglice were different colour and glowed, I later read about this being a prarsite that changes the colour of the water hoglice so that it is more likely to be eaten and pass from host to host, incredible! (Pictures coming soon)</p>

        <h2>More Native British Aquaria</h2>
        <p>Due to moving out of student alls I had to dismantle each tank but I planned new ones for my second year house! (Pictures coming soon) </p>
