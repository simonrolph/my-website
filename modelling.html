            <p>A quick run-down on the software and techniques I regularly use when producing ecological models and working with large and complex data sets. I am always learning new skills and building on others. Technology is always changing and I want to be able to always upgrade to better systems and workflows. If there is something you feel is lacking from my skillset then please let me know via <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/simon_rolph">Twitter</a>!</p>

It is my go-to tool for manipulating, visualising and analysising data, in addition to producing ecological models. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as a user interface for R to improve my workflow. Key packages I use are; <a target="_blank" href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">dplyr</a> (also see this useful data wrangling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a>) </td>

I have previously used the open source eqiuvalant software; <a target="_blank" href="www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a>. When producing maps I make sure to follow the comprehensive <a target="_blank" href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/graphics-for-conservation/index">'Graphics for Conservation'</a> guide produced by Oryx.</td> 
                <td>My motivation to learn HTML, the language of the web, is to be able to communicate my scientific ideas clearly and imformatively. <a target="_blank" href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a> is a way of easily producing graphs for online publishing, it is open source and connects well with R and ggplot2. I write my HTML in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brackets.io/">Brackets </a>a clean, open source HTML editor. I am learning javascript as a way to make my web design more interative and engaging. Additionally, I try to bring together other widgets and tools that can be embedded, which you will find on throughout this website.</td>

            <h2>Recent Projects and Courses</h2>
            
            <p><b>COMPADRE database project:</b> An extensive research project using the COMPADRE plant matrix database. The database is an R object with 6242 entries and metadata. I produced a HTML readout of each entry in the matrix so that I could browse the database easier than through the R console or exporting to an Excel sheet. The project also had a literature review component looking at the original papers, I created an Access database to input my data from the literature review, but then decided an Excel spreadsheet was easier to use. I constructed mutiple models to test my hypothesis and analysed data in R. When the project is finished I will create a page dedicated to it's results with graphs produced in Plotly.</p>
            
            <p><b>Marine Spacial Ecology (Third Year Module):</b> A comprehensive 10 week course in ArcGIS, primarily dealing with marine data but with transferable skills such as making maps from data tables to shape files, spacial analysis. Including carrying out our own fieldwork and data collection.</p>
            
            <p><b>Epidemic Modelling Module (Third Year Module):</b> Used R to construct SIR epidemic modules, analysyse the output and experiment with implementing different disease preventation strategies such as vaccination. We then compared their effectiveness, this was all carried out in R using ggplot2 to visualise the data.</p>
            
            <p><b>Mathematical Biology (Third Year Module):</b> Using MATLAB to produce more mathematical models including; epidemic dynamics, optimal management modelling, game theory and evolution of cooperation. This module had a lot of pure mathematical content including; solving differential equation and equilibrium theory.</p>
            
            <p><b>Tenerife Field Course:</b> Two other students and I carried out a two day field study into invertebrate communities underneath rocks to see if the theory of island biogeography plays a role in this model system. Data was input into excel and imported into R for analysis. We also recorded gps coordinates of of the rocks allowing me to produce a GIS map of the area over satellite image of the area to illustrate the field site for my research poster. </p>
            
            <p><b>Mathematics of the Environment (Second Year Module):</b> Using MATLAB to produce mathematical models; climate modelling, epidemic modelling and population projection matrices. This model introduced me to the foundations of coding, a skill that has grown ever since. We wrote a total of four reports during the span of this module and were constantly coding and working on our MATLAB programs.</p>
            <p><b>Iceland Field Course:</b> An intensive week-long field course of data collection, analysis and presenting to the rest of the group. In a group of 11 we collected data and colaboratively input into a Google spreadsheet. I was in charge of data analysis in R and produced a number of graphs including an ordination plot of species dissimilarity between sites in geothermally heated streams, and those not heated. I used the vegan package in R to produce these plots.</p>
            
            <p><b>Online Courses Completed:</b> Code Academy SQL</p>
