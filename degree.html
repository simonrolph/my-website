In addition, we will explore simple analysis of reaction kinetics; biological waves and diffusion driven instabilities; and the effects of geometry and pattern formation on animals. <a target="_blank" href="http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/current/modules/description/index.php?moduleCode=ECM3905">More infomation</a></td>

We will investigate how adaptation to different temperature regimes impacts on the metabolism of the stream microbial communities. <a target="_blank" href="http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/current/modules/description/index.php?moduleCode=
