<h4><u>Funding:</u></h4>
<p>The PhD fellowship is funded through the prestigious Leverhulme Centre for Advanced Biological Modelling (CABM), providing support to develop a PhD within the project outline described below at the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences in Dr Salguero-Gómez’ research group.</p>

<h4><u>Outline:</u></h4>
<p>At what age should you have your first baby? And how many babies? When should you retire? How long will you live? These are crucial life events that dictate our wellbeing, that of society and global economies. These life history events conform life history strategies, governed by trade-offs (e.g. highly reproductive individuals typically have short lives). The specific life history strategies (i.e. ways in which an organism goes about making its living) followed by individuals is crucial to the wellbeing of any species, not just humans, as it determines the viability, resilience and functioning of the populations of all organisms worldwide. Yet, the underpinnings of such life history strategies are poorly understood. The wealth of data and quantitative methods necessary to adequately explore this question begs for a strong mathematical foundation. The need for this knowledge becomes ever more important in the light of climate change, which is expected to alter survival, growth and reproduction of individuals, and thus displace current optimal strategies. This project will quantify how constrained life history strategies are across thousands of animals and plant species worldwide using the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, and determine their major a/biotic drivers. The outputs of this project will improve our predictions on the impacts of predicted shifts in climate on animal and plant resilience and viability.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Development of robust mathematical metrics of life history events and clustering of events into distinct life history strategies.</li>
    <li>Inference of life history events for species with imperfect demographic data using phylogenetic techniques and weighted interpolation.</li>
    <li>Development of hierarchical models to predict optimal life history strategies as a function of current and future climatic conditions using game theory, differential equations and integro- difference equations.</li>
    <li>Matching of species performance to spatially geo-referenced climatic information.</li>
</ul>
