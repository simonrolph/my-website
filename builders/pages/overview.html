PhD Overview
<h1>PhD Overview</h1>
<h3>Optimal life histories in a variable world</h3>
<hr>

The patterns of growth, reproduction and death in organisms vary so wildly from species to species. Some species grow fast, reproduce vast numbers of offspring, and die young. Others take a slower pace, reproduce more considerately, and live to a ripe old age. Unfortunately, the diversity of life history strategies is not just a sliding scale from 0 to 1, ecology is never that simple. However, field scientists have collected data on the demography of hundreds of plants and animal species, these have been collated into the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Plant Matrix Database. This presents a fascinating opportunity to quantify the spectrum of life history strategies - can we put different species into neat little boxes and classify them with neat labels? Probably not. All this glorious data also presents a whole array of challenges and complications, for which I’m developing methods (involving imaginary plants) to help tackle these challenges.
