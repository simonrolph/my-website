        <p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Sheffield. That's the main thing going on in my life at the moment. I love wildlife and outdoorness; getting on my bike or going for long walks in the Peak District. But I also like coding, and steam trains. I'm a huge fan of botanical gardens and I have a terrible habit of taking lots of pictures of plants and never getting around to identifying them.</p>

<h4>About my research</h4>
<p>My research is taking a data-driven and modelling approach to investigating life history strategies across the tree of life. My initial approach will be working with the COMPADRE plant matrix database and COMADRE plant matrix database to look at broad scale trends in life history strategies.</p>
<p>I am a member of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/robresearchsite/">Salgo Team</a>, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-GÃ³mez. The group's ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism' life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.</p><a href="overview.html">Read more about my PhD</a>

<h4>COMPADRE & COMADRE</h4>
<p>I have been helping to develop the latest iteration of the COMPADRE & COMADRE database; migrating to an online relational database and Flask (Python-based framework) web application. This started with work I did in the summer of 2016 during internship with the Exeter node of the COMPADRE & COMADRE network. This is a project spearheaded by Dave Hodgson's research group in the Cornwall Campus of The University of Exeter and I continue to work on it alongside my PhD. You can see an early preview of the database  <a target="_blank" href="demography.exeter.ac.uk">here</a>. We hope that the project will be online late 2017. </p>

            <p>We went to Tenerife as part of the final year of my BSc in Conservation Biology and Ecology. I produced a mini-series of one minute videos showcasing the spectacular landscapes and the diverse wildlife we saw around the islands.</p>

            <p>I had brought all my video-making gear with me but I wasn't sure what video I was going to make. I reached Rosemullion Head, with its abundance of wonderful wildflowers, and spontaneously made this video. I'm very proud of it and want to make videos like it soon.</p>
