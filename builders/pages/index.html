<h4>About my research</h4>
<p>My research is taking a data-driven and modelling approach to investigating life history strategies across the tree of life. My initial approach will be working with the COMPADRE plant matrix database and COMADRE plant matrix database to look at broad scale trends in life history strategies.</p>
<p>I am a member of Salgo Team, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-GÃ³mez. The group's ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism' life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.</p> <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/robresearchsite/">Salgo Team </a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/salgoteam">Follow @salgoteam</a> | <a href="overview.html">Read more about my PhD...</a>

<h4>COMPADRE & COMADRE</h4>
<p>In addition to using the data in COMPADRE & COMADRE, I have been helping to develop the latest iteration of the database; migrating to an online relational database and Flask (Python-based framework) application. This started with the work I did in the summer of 2016 during internship with the Exeter node of the COMPADRE & COMADRE network. This is a project spearheaded by Dave Hodgson's research group in the Cornwall Campus of The University of Exeter and I continue to work on it alongside my PhD, as a fruitful collaboration. We hope that the project will be online late 2017. </p>
