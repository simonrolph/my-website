        <p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Sheffield. That's the main thing going on in my life at the moment. I love wildlife and outdoorness; getting on my bike or going for long walks in the Peak District. But I also like coding, and steam trains. I'm a huge fan of botanical gardens and I have a terrible habit of taking lots of pictures of plants and never getting around to identifying them.</p>

<h4>About My Research</h4>


    
<p>The patterns of growth, reproduction and death in organisms vary so wildly from species to species. Some species grow fast, reproduce vast numbers of offspring, and die young. Others take a slower pace, reproduce more considerately, and live to a ripe old age. Unfortunately, the diversity of life history strategies is not just a sliding scale from 0 to 1, ecology is never that simple. However, field scientists have collected data on the demography of hundreds of plants and animal species, these have been collated into the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Plant Matrix Database. This presents a fascinating opportunity to quantify the spectrum of life history strategies - can we put different species into neat little boxes and classify them with neat labels? Probably not, but maybe there are some general trends. All this glorious data also presents a whole array of challenges and complications, so I’m developing methods (involving imaginary plants) to help tackle these challenges. Aside from my primary research focus, I'm also keen on finding ineresting ways to present science through websites and videos.</p>

<h4>Lab Groups</h4>
<p>I am part of Dylan Child's lab group. We don't have a website yet because Dylan hasn't got around to finishing it. But, from his webpage on the University of Sheffield he says: "I am particularly keen to understand how demographic, environmental and ecological processes interact to influence these processes. I also develop theory and methods for modelling and analysis of structured populations." That's pretty cool. He also co-authored a really fab book about Integral Projections Models (IPMs) which is very useful.</p>

<p>I'm a member of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/robresearchsite/">Salgo Team</a>, the research group of Dr Rob Salguero-Gómez. The group's ultimate goal is to develop an integrative academic research plan to use molecular, anatomic and physiological approaches to examine demographic aspects of an organism' life cycle through a combination angles including field and lab work, as well as ecological modeling and comparative biology.</p>

<h4>COMPADRE & COMADRE Matrix Databases</h4>
<p>I have been helping to develop the latest iteration of the COMPADRE & COMADRE database; migrating to an online relational database and Flask (Python-based framework) web application. This started with work I did in the summer of 2016 during internship with the Exeter node of the COMPADRE & COMADRE network. This is a project spearheaded by Dave Hodgson's research group in the Cornwall Campus of The University of Exeter. You can see an early preview of the database  <a target="_blank" href="demography.exeter.ac.uk">here</a>. We hope that the project will be online late 2017. </p>

            <p>We went to Tenerife as part of the final year of my BSc in Conservation Biology and Ecology. I produced a mini-series of one minute videos showcasing the spectacular landscapes and the diverse wildlife we saw around the islands.</p>

            <p>I had brought all my video-making gear with me but I wasn't sure what video I was going to make. I reached Rosemullion Head, with its abundance of wonderful wildflowers, and spontaneously made this video. I'm very proud of it and want to make videos like it soon.</p>
